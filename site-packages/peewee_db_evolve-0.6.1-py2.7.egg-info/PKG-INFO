Description: Peewee DB Evolve
        ================
        
        Diffs your models against your database, and outputs SQL to
        (non-destructively) update your schema.
        
        Think of it as ``db.create_tables()`` on steriods (which doesn't drop
        your database).
        
        You can also think of it as schema migrations, without having to
        actually write the migrations.
        
        Quick Start
        -----------
        
        1. Run: ``sudo pip install peewee-db-evolve``
        2. Add ``import peeweedbevolve`` anywhere before your models are
           defined.
        3. Run ``db.evolve()`` where you would have normally run
           ``db.create_tables()``, and enjoy!

        Frequently Asked Questions
        --------------------------
        
        *Does this work with existing projects, or only with new projects?*
        
        This works very well with existing projects. If your API only works with
        new projects, you're probably doing it wrong.
        
        *Don't you give up control by not writing your own migrations?*
        
        Managing your schema by writing your own migrations is kind of like
        managing your source code by writing your own ``patch`` files in
        addition to writing your actual code. A well vetted ``diff`` tool is
        going to be better and faster at it than you.
        
        *How old / well vetted is this tool?*
        
        This project has been in production use since August 2016. (We switched
        to Peewee as an ORM.) But it's a style of schema management I've been
        using for ~10 years now.
